# Fixes Applied for Grey Screen and Wallet Creation

## ðŸ”§ **Issues Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Grey Loading Screen**
**Problem**: App showing grey background instead of proper colors
**Solution**: 
- Added proper `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` backgrounds to all containers
- Added loading state with spinner and proper styling
- Fixed Dialog component background colors
- Added shadow to main container for better visual separation

### **Issue 2: Wallet Creation Not Working**
**Problem**: `generateSeiWallet` import was causing issues
**Solution**:
- Removed problematic external import
- Created inline wallet generation function with enhanced randomness
- Added proper error handling and fallback
- Ensured "Create New Wallet" button properly calls `generateWallet()`

### **Issue 3: Loading State Management**
**Problem**: No loading indicator while checking for existing wallet
**Solution**:
- Added `isLoading` state to HomeTab
- Shows spinner while checking localStorage
- Prevents grey screen during initialization
- Proper loading message with SeiPulse branding

## âœ… **What Should Work Now**

### **Home Screen**
1. **Loading**: Shows "Loading... ðŸš€" with spinner
